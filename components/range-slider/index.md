 ## General overview

 A special button to let the user select a value or range from a fixed set of options.

 {:.alert.alert-info}
 * Work best when there are lists of few average values or ranges.
 * For many specific values other input controls are preferable such as [dropdown inputs](../../components/dropdown-input/) or [text inputs](../../components/text-input/).
 * This control is quite complex to use and might involve accessibility issues, so itâ€™s important to read carefully this usage page.
 * Often used as forms inputs but also for interactive previews or timelines.

 Associated patterns: [Forms]( ../../ui-patterns/forms/), [Search, sort and filter](../../ui-patterns/search-sort-and-filter/), [interactive timeline](../../ui-patterns/charts/interactive-timeline/), [interactive preview](../../ui-patterns/charts/interactive-preview/).

 ## Behaviour

 Values within the slider can be selected either tapping or clicking on the range bar, or dragging the slider ball to a side.

 Through keyboard users can access it by tabbing and pressing the right left/ arrows.

 **The wider or the denser the range selectable through a slider, the harder it is to select a precise value ([steering law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_law)).**

#- title: F Pattern
#  text: The F-pattern is a natural way for the user to go through content within an unconstrained container, such as a form on the page itself. The user will go through the content line-by-line, arriving at a call to action at the end.
