do: >

 * Provide scrolling on one page.

 * Ensure navigation and confirmation buttons are permanently visible.
 
 * Give focus to the first input field.
 
 * If there are less than 6 elements available, show selection options (instead of a drop-down).
 
 * Provide a label to the input fields.
 
 * Try to use 1 column in mobile.
 
 * Use inline validation.
 
 * Consider providing basic help text.
