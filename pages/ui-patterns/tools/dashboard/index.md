what:
 With a quick glance, a good dashboard gives the user the most relevant information to start with.

why:
 The dashboard design pattern gives (real-time) insights about relevant information; operational, strategic and / or analytical information.

do: >
 * Keep the amount of information balanced, to avoid distraction.

 * Filter and condense the key data, using summaries and exceptions.

 * Organise the content into meaningful groups, to support its meaning.

 * Make the dashboard clean and simple, to make it easy to scan and understand.

 * The visual design should be minimalistic, but still aesthetically pleasing.

 * Personalise the dashboard for its users.

 * Fit the information on one page/screen.

dont: >
 * Add secondary information and visual elements that distract from the key data.

 * It is not an overview plus data, introduction or a portal.
