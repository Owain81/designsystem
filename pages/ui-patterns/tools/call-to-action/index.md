what: >
 A call to action is usually, a big button which is highlighted, representing the primary action in a context.

why: >
 It grabs the attention of the user in order to complete a flow successfully or quickly engage with applications that have a specific global driving action (taking photos, sharing, recording entries…).


do: >
 * Be concise when labeling and specify the action, always being descriptive.

 * Stand out button style: floating, contrasting…

 * Use only for user’s primary choice and when necessary.
 
 * Button should be flow-specific and screen-specific.
 
 * If needed use primary and secondary CTA buttons.
 
 * Combine with secondary buttons if necessary.
 
 * Embed if necessary in a toolbar or navigation bar.
 
 * Consider using it to present a single action in mobile instead of a toolbar.

dont: >
 * It is not recommended to use more than one CTA per type on a screen.

 * Use for minor actions like trash, alerts, nonspecific actions, limited tasks like cutting text, changing volume…
 
 * Combine with badges.
