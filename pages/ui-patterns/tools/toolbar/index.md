what: >
 A bar containing action buttons that offers utilities for the user that can be applied to items in a view or panel. Example: filter, sort, actions, find, change view.

why: >
 So the user can have to hand the most used actions and feels in control of the app.

do: >
 * Use understandable icons, otherwise use labels.

 * Place dividers and spacing to organise the tools.

 * Toolbar should be hierarchically on top of the content it affects.

dont: >
 * Confuse with a navigation design pattern.

 * Display too many tools at the same time especially in mobile.
 
 * Separate actions from object content except by using temporal elements (such as a pop up).
