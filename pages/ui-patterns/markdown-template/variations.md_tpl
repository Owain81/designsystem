what:
 An element reflecting the system reaction after a user action. It can either be a passive element or conceived as a mandatory step.

title-variation-1: Passive confirmation

what-variation-1: >
 A text message, multi-state button, animation, or graphic representation which confirms the operation that the user just did.    

why-variation-1: >
 In some contexts, the users are expected to switch views frequently and they should be highly aware of the alternate views.

do-variation-1: >
 * Try to use an icon and label per tab and always be consistent in form and placement.

 * Allow navigation by connecting tabs to specific page content; through tab selection or content swiping.

 * Highlight the tab selected.

 * Depending on the screen-size, the quantity of the tabs can differ but the number should be the same within the same app.
 
 * Generally use a limited number of tabs with equal width, and short labels (fixed tabs).
 
 * Consider pushing the tabs limit by squeezing in several tabs.
 
 * Consider making tabs scrollable, in order to use a larger number of tabs and/or longer tab titles.
 
 * Consider using OS based tabs styles for navigation tabs: like app tabs for Windows.

dont-variation-1: >
 * Use tab buttons for a specific action (it is not a toolbar).

 * Disconnect tab from its content (physically).
 
 * Present tabs in different rows.
 
 * Add nested sub-tabs.
 
 * Donâ€™t pair tabs with content that also supports swiping.
 
 * Use comparison of content across tabs, the displayed information should be exclusive.
 

title-variation-2: Mandatory confirmation
 
what-variation-2: >
  A question to the users to verify that they really do want to proceed with the action they just initiated.

why-variation-2: >
  To allow users to understand the consequences of their actions, and to have the choice to either accept or reject that action.
 
do-variation-2: >
  * Ask for a second interaction to complete a user action.

  * Talk to the user in a direct way: clearly indicate the action and its consequences, if these are big.

  * Consider using a modal design pattern and/or pairing it with a warning.

  * Use a call to action (preferably no more than 1).

dont-variation-2: >
 * Use very often within the application, over-warning.

 * Use many consecutively.

 * Use when consequences of an action are reversible or negligible.

 * Confuse with a validation (it is not an error message or passive confirmation).
