what: >
 It is opened from a Filter or Refine label, or icons that clearly show the filtering criteria that can be applied.

why:
 The user needs to update a specific category of a list or table, and the sort labels are long. Or, there are several options that take up more screen space.

do: >
 * Filter options should be clearly worded and easy to understand.

 * Provide visual cues to show the filters that are applied when the overlay is closed.

dont: >
 * It is not a sort overlay.

 * Add too many options, use a filter drawer instead.

tags: >
 Sort, menu, dropdown, modal, dialog, result, search, find, options, order.
