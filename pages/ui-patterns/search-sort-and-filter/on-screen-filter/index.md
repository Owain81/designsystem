permalink: ui-patterns/search-sort-and-filter/on-screen-filter/
design-pattern-type: mobile

what:
 An option to select the information that should be displayed on the search results screen. With one tap, the filter is applied.

why:
 There is enough space on the screen to show the filter, and these are relevant to find different information categories.

do: >
 * Filtering options should be clearly worded and easy to understand.

 * When possible, provide visual cues to show the filters that are applied, or which are "on", especially if the filter controls are sometimes hidden.

dont: >
 * It is not a screen sort, it does not order. It selects some information and excludes other.
