what: >
 A menu that partly covers the screen, showing options to order the page contents in a specific way.

why: >
 To allow users to find specific information within a large amount of results, while keeping the focus.

do: >
 * Locate the sort options near other tools for manipulating the results list, such as filters, view toggles and the “clear search” button.

 * Apply a reasonable default sort order.

 * Clearly show which sort option is active.

dont: >
 * It is not a filter overlay.

 * Add too many options, use a sort form instead.
