what:
 It relies on an explicit user action to perform the search and get results. Type the search term, then tap on the search icon or press Return on the keyboard to see the results.

why:
 The user needs to search within a list or table.

do: >
 * Provide a search box for the user.

 * Consider offering other types of search apart from text (like barcodes or photos).

 * Consider combining it with autocomplete or saved, recent and popular search design patterns.

 * In mobile, consider displaying a full page modal search.

 * Always provide a clear way to exit the search pattern (for example, with a cancel button).

dont: >
 * Make it difficult to exit the search pattern.
