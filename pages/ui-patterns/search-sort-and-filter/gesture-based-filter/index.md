what: >
 Pinch, zoom, and pan gestures can be used to filter results whose relevance is dependent on location, such as on a map, chart, or graph. Used only for touch-based devices.

why: >
 You need to provide a zooming interaction to show a view of a certain area in a dynamic environment.

do: >
 * Consider combining it with other filtering options, since location may be only one of the user's criteria.

 * Give enough area to complete the action.

dont: >
 * Support navigation, it just filters.

 * It is not recommended to combine with scroll.

tags: >
 Swipe, flick, action, gesture, translation, page.
