what: >
 A list with all possible results, which is updated as the user performs a query, leaving the matching results.

why:
 The user is orientated by a small overview of the results, and can then quickly filter them.

do: >
 * Use for constrained data sets, such as an address book or a personal media library.

 * Combine with an autocomplete pattern.

 * Consider combining it with other filter options.

dont: >
 * It should not be used for searching very large data sets, such as a retailerâ€™s inventory.

 * Automatically update the results without user interaction (not as an implicit search).
