what: >
 A panel with different advanced sorting options, that are separate from the results.

why: >
 To allow users to find very specific information within a large amount of results, keeping the focus on the sort options.

do: >
 * Consider if the user really needs so many filter options.

 * Clearly show which sort option is active.

 * If combining sort and filter in a single form, keep the screen as clean as possible.

 * Consider using “Done”, “Apply” or “Back” buttons to clearly communicate the action.

 * Remember to show the user the desired results.


dont: >
 * In mobile, mix with the results page, which will make the page cluttered.
