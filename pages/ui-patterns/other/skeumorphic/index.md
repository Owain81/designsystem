what: >
 An interface designed to match its real-world counterpart, often used in games.

why: >
 It helps users remember a page easily and can make the interaction more intuitive, improving learnability and the elementsâ€™ affordance. 

do: >
 * Show similarities in shape with objects existing in the real world.

 * Consider using it for example lists, card collections, and customisable components.

 * Consider using textures and other realistic attributes.

 * Use for few elements and reduced interactions, since it can easily add clutter.

dont: >
 * It is not necessary to add texture or a 100% hyper-realistic sensation.

 * It is not something created for the digital world without being first a physical object.
