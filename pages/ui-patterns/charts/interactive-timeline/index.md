what: >
 An interactive graphical representation of a period in time, on which important events are marked.

why: >
 To show the user an overview over time, that will reveal information they didn’t know before. 

do: >
 * Keep it clear.

 * Use legends, make sure the user understands the elements.

 * Make clear what the timespan is. Day, week, month and year options or maybe even hours.

 * Create a timespan selector. Give the user control about the content.

 * Use play buttons for an automatic display.

 * Make it interactive, clickable and zoom-able.

 * Divide visually different kind of elements through colors and graphs for example.

 * Always communicate, even when there is no content to show (in that case, say why).

 * Create the possibility to hide or show content, but make clear how to unhide.

 * Give it a header describing the timeline.

 * Use a help pattern for the user when it is needed.

 * Give controls enough size to make interaction easy.

dont: >
 * It is not a dashboard, it provides interactive controls.

 * Confuse the user with too many user interface elements in the same timeline and at the same time.

 * Don’t add too much overlay panels for extra information, try to balance.
