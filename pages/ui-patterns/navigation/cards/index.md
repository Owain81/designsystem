what: >
 Header-less panels, that can contain a photo, text, link or components, all related to a single subject. It can allow navigation to a separate page and include common card deck manipulations, such as stacking, shuffling, discarding and flipping (using swipe).

why: >
 They are extremely well-suited for mobile environment, since it’s easy to scan. Also, it’s well-suited for showcasing elements whose size or supported actions vary, such as photos with captions of variable length.

do: >
 * Cards should be a summarised info, but not just a header, they should be meaningful.

 * Make the card expandable / collapsible if the amount of information is too large.

 * Cards can contain buttons and other components.

 * In mobile make the card fit the whole width of the screen canvas (list view), if there are many cards which contains complex info / data (making the page more difficult to read).

 * It can be used for primary navigation, a dashboard or a list.

dont: >
 * Do not add more than 2 different interactions apart from the card itself.

tags: >
