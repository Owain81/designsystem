design-pattern-type: mobile

what: >
 A dynamic menu that allows navigation or taking actions, within a circled collection of links. It is often used in games.

why: >
 Allow users to navigate quickly within a small range of simple options. Works well at the OS level (see Paranoid Android OS).

do: >
 * Interaction with the menu should be consistent and natural with enough space to tap.

 * Use universal icons, otherwise combine with labels.

 * Provide a button to open/close the menu.

 * Can offer navigation options or tools.

dont: >
 * Not recommended for primary navigation within apps, it can create conflicts between OS and the apps.

 * Use for a menu with multiple levels and options.

 * Use for a flat information architecture page (in that case use a Tab pattern instead).
