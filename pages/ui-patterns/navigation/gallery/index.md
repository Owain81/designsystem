 They display live content arranged in grid tiles, a carousel or a slideshow.

why: >
 For those cases in which the user needs to browse through a series of images with a high resolution, in a sequential way with a sense of beginning and end.

do: >
 * Use for cases in which highly visual content is frequently updated.

 * Consider providing thumbnails (small version of the image) or numbers.

 * Consider how to browse images: automatically, manually or both.

 * Consider combining it with a bulk actions design pattern.

dont: >
 * Use when titles are the same or more important than images, in this case use a card layout instead.
