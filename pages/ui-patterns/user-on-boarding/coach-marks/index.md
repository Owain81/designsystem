design-pattern-type: mobile

what:
 Much like tips, coach marks help users understand how to interact with the app’s user interface. They typically take over a full screen with a gradient.

why:
 As part of a tutorial during the user on-boarding process, to learn app shortcuts, gestures (in mobile devices), and interactions with elements from the user’s browser.

do: >
 * Add a gradient behind them, taking user’s attention away from the app.

 * Use fonts and arrows that looks handwritten to make it feel more personal and avoid blending in with the rest of your app and getting ignored.

 * Keep the content short, specific and related to a specific action. Like with [Tips](../../user-on-boarding/tips/)/ [Product tours](../../user-on-boarding/product-tours/).

 * Use sparingly, for cases in which the user action does not rely on an app’s screen element (otherwise use [Tips](../../user-on-boarding/tips/) or other on-boarding patterns).


dont: >
 * Get confuse by [Tips](../../user-on-boarding/tips/). Unlike these, coach marks shouldn’t be related to a screen element.

 * Avoid using multiple coach marks per screen and at the same time.


 See [Tutorials](../../help/tutorials/) best practices for other do's and don'ts.
