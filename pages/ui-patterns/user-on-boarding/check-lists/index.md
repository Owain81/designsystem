what:
 A series of tasks often used for long-term on-boarding items and also during checkouts and other long [multistep/wizard](../../navigation/multistep-wizard/) processes.

why:
 It helps users know what is expected of them to do.

do: >
 * Put it on the side of your welcome screen or product, they are complimentary.

 * In mobile, consider to [drill down](../../charts/drill-down/) to the individual tasks using a different page for each step.

 * Check the [multistep/wizard](../../navigation/multistep-wizard/) design pattern indications.

 * Write list items to have approximately similar line lengths.

 * Use numbered lists only when the sequence or count of items are important.

 * Use consistent style of phrasing: for example start always with a verb.

 * Distinguishing keywords at the beginning of each check item to make the list contents easy to differentiate.

 * Introduce the list with a clear, descriptive sentence or phrase.

 * Capitalize the first word of every list item, for ease of scanning.

dont: >
 * Not to be confuse with progress bar.

 * Use it as the primary content for a user on-boarding flow. They simply compliment it.

 * Not recommended to leave the checkpoints without ending punctuation, when these are full sentences.
