what:
 Automatic information that temporally overlaps a specific section of the screen providing anintroductory description. They are often used during the new users on-boarding process within an app, or to introduce new features.

why:
 To help users to understand the meaning of an interface element or section so they can get into the right workflow, making the experience confidence-inspiring.

do: >
 * Place tips in proximity to the action or menu item they apply to.
 
 * Keep the content short, specific and related to a specific tool or action.
 
 * Remove the tip once interaction begins.
 
 * Suggest the first step in the workflow for new users.
 
 * Should stand out.

dont: >
 * Confuse with other kinds of overlays (like an overlay for sorting, modals, dialogs etc.).
 
 * Be semi-transparent. Donâ€™t obscure elements of the UI and force users to sit through an unwanted tour.
 
 * Avoid using multiple tips per screen and at the same time.
 
 * Use persistently over time.
