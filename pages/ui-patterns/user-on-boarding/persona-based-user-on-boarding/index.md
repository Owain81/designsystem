what:
 Give each persona an introductory experience based on their needs/motivations.
 Some user-onboarding flows prompt users to select their own course of action. Each option leads into different first-run experiences. This branching can happen without the user knowing it–by using data collected on signup–or perhaps they ask the user what they want to do.

why:
 When a new user starts using your product, they may already have an idea in mind for what they want to do first. It should help users get more relevant first-run experiences that should lead to higher engagement rates.

do: >
 * Start with an option after a user has filled out a signup form.

 * The option may be a clear choice for the user to make based on their desires, or it may be to select their job role.

 * When asking the user to choose, make it enjoyable and fun, it is a special moment related to your whole app's experience.

dont: >
 * Include too many choices for the user to select as you do not want to overwhelm them. From what we’ve seen, 3 options seem to be the magic number.

 * Be boring, without any emotional or personality element.
