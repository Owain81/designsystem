what:
 A kind of tutorial consisting in boxes with pointers that call out and contextualize certain elements within a product, most often come in the form of [tips](../../user-on-boarding/tips/).

why:
 Orient new users and help them figure out the fastest way to get to their first moment of value. Tours often walk a user through an important workflow or point out a few key steps along the way that might otherwise be missed.

do: >
 * Make your first tooltip open on pageload.

 * Focus your copy on value rather than how-to. This will help keep a user motivated.

 * Design your tooltips to look native to your productâ€™s brand, but make sure it also stands out enough to be noticed.

 * Include easy to read analytics on your product tour, you should know how far users are making it and how this affects their ultimate success with your product.

 * Place tips in proximity to the action or menu item they apply to.

 * Keep the content short, specific and related to a specific tool or action.

dont: >
 * Use less than 1 tooltip and no more than 6 (it starts to feel like a hassle for new users).

 * Use more than 140 characters on the text in the box. Keep it short.

 * Avoid using multiple tips per screen and at the same time.

 * Use persistently over time without letting to skip the tour.
