what:
 Any greeting that is only seen once for new users and usually contains text such as hello or welcome—the message most often includes an opportunity for action.

why:
 To greet new users and make them feel more confident. It can also help to set expectations for what is next to come and the tone for their first-run experience.

do: >
 * Use modal window to separate the on-boarding experience from the application itself.

 * Use a layer of transparency to give users a peek into the actual application.

 * When required input from user, use full-screen to block visibility into your app to focus the user entirely on the message.

 * Use your welcome message as step one to get your users to their Aha moment.

 * Show enthusiasm! (use exclamation mark).

 * Reiterate your value proposition.

 * Set expectations and be clear on what it will happen next.

dont: >
 * Show it more than once to your user.

 * Forget to include skip option when asking for more information.
