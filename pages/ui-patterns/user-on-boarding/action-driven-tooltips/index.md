what:
 Action-driven tooltips accentuate elements such as form fields or buttons to guide a user through a specific feature or process. Once a user completes a step, they are guided on to the next one.

why:
 For more technical workflows, action-driven tooltips can be a game changer in terms of your activation and retention rates.

do: >
 * Consider to make users to follow a certain set of instructions by highlighting a given element in your app and darkening the space around it.

 * Help users to dismiss them easily.

 * Use each just once for the user.

 * Information should really add value to the user experience and be clear, to the point.

 * As with everything else, analyze and test them.

 * Consider including a next button to move to the next action, if it is part of a serie.

 * Use only one at a time.

 * Remove the tooltip once interaction begins.

 * Use when users consent to take a tour or as part of a [tutorial](../../help/tutorials/).

 * Use very sparingly, and consider using other on-boarding methods instead (like [Tips](../../user-on-boarding/tips/) and [product/feature tours](../../user-on-boarding/product-tours/)).


dont: >
 * Use for not relevant information.

 * Use where it is not helping but distracting from the user goal.

 * Show more than 3â€“4 in a row. Users get fatigued quickly and need time to act on/ digest what you have taught.

 * In general, don't obscure other interface elements.

 * Force the user to do it, without having chosen it or being able to dismiss it.
