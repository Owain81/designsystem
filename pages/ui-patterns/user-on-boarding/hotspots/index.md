what:
 Temporary visual indicators in the form of circles or shadows that call the attention through motion over a a screen element. It is usually combined with tooltips on [product or feature tours](../../user-on-boarding/product-tours/) to guide the user over a specific flow.

why:
 Used to give a little bit of contextual help to entice new users to activate certain elements or features of your product.

do: >
 * Include unique pulsing animations to catch a user’s eye.

 * Adjust the intensity of your hotspots’ animation depending on how important the hotspot information might be to your user’s success.

 * Consider adding a label to describe the usage of the tap target to introduce the flow.

 * Use for actions that are important for the user goals.

 * Consider to use once the user did an action indicated by a tooltip or other hotspot to guide the user in the next step of the flow in [product or feature tours](../../user-on-boarding/product-tours/).

 * Use when they will help the user to complete better the action they’re taking.

 * Display them during natural pauses in the user experience.


dont: >
 * Don’t obscure elements of the UI and force users to sit through an unwanted tour.

 * Avoid using multiple hotspots per screen and at the same time.

 * Use persistently over time.

 * Avoid displaying Hotspots prompts at interruptive moments.

 * Use smaller, simpler prompts that request user input (use other [contextual help](../../help/contextual-help/) instead of hotspots).

 * Use for actions that doesn't need explanation.
