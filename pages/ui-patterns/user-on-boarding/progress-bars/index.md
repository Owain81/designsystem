what:
 It is a completeness meter that visually indicates the progression of a task. It is usually integrated inside overview pages, as well as within a [multistep](../../navigation/multistep-wizard/) design pattern in desktop.

why:
 Provide the feeling of accomplisment, motivation, and an overview during processes such as user on-boarding or a [multi-step/ wizard](../../navigation/multistep-wizard/), and for overview pages containing charts such as a [dashboard](../../navigation/dashboard/).
 

 It can also be used as a dynamic chart to allow the users having a general overview of progress against a set of goals. Also for reflecting the progress of the [system status](../../feedback-notifications/system-status/).

do: >
 * Start with a substantial percentage of the bar filled out, this helps users feel like they are already underway instead of starting from scratch, and it increases a personâ€™s desire to complete the task at hand.

 * Reflect  progress dynamically after the users's action.

 * Consider to use as a chart with different section colours, allowing to compare progress with different parameters.

dont: >
 * Not recommended for mobile devices as a part of a [multistep](../../navigation/multistep-wizard/) (see this design pattern).
