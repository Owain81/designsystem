## What is motion?
### In the real world (Physics)

It is the change of an object position with respect to the time. It is typically described in terms of displacement, distance, rapidity, acceleration, time and speed. In addition, some physical properties of the object (mass, weight, volume, shape,...) may change when an external force acts upon it.


### In the real world (Graphics)

It is the utilization of digital footage and/or animation technology to create the illusion of movement, sometimes combined with audio for use in multimedia projects.

### Definition

Motion design is the resultant discipline based on the features of the natural world (**physics**), the virtual one (**motion graphics**), logical (**mental model**) and geometric (**Maths**) which let the user to understand interactive interfaces, know how applications work and feel the control of them. In addition, it helps the rest of the disciplines (UI, Visual Design and Front-end) to fill their lacks as well as create and complete powerful solutions in a dynamic way by moving and transforming the elements in the screen.

## 12 principles of animation

Disney's Twelve Basic Principles of Animation is a set of principles introduced by Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas.

The main purpose of the principles was to produce an illusion of characters adhering to the basic laws of physics, but they also dealt with more abstract issues, such as emotional timing and character appeal.

### Squash & Stretch


It gives the illusion of weight and volume to a character as it moves.

### Staging

It’s the presentation of an idea so it is clear.

### Anticipation

Prepare the audience for a major action that the character is about to perform. The major action is preceded by specific moves that anticipate the audience what is about to happen.

### Straight ahead & pose to pose

**Pose to pose** - The animation starts by drawing a few key frames, to fill in the intervals later.

**Straight ahead** - The animation starts at the first drawing and advances frame by frame to the end of the scene.

### Follow through & overlapping

When the main body of the character stops, all other parts continue to catch up the main mass. **Nothing stops all at once!**

### Slow in & slow out

As the action starts, we have more drawings near the starting pose, less in the middle and more drawings again near the next pose.
Few drawings make the action faster and more drawings make the action slower.

### Arcs

All actions, with few exceptions, follow an arc or a similar curved path. Arcs give an animation more natural action and a better flow.

### Secondary action

It’s an additional action in the scene used as a supplement of the main one in order to reinforce it and add more dimension.

### Timing

Timing reinforces the illusion that an object abides by the laws of physics.
(Directly linked with the “Slow in & Slow out” and “Follow through & overlapping” principles)

### Exaggeration

Remain true to reality, but present it in a wilder, more extreme form.

### Solid drawings

It means taking into account forms in 3D space giving them all volume and weight (*)

_(*) This is a principle of classic animation. In web and software animations, our objects won't be three-dimensional._

### Appeal

It’s a quality of characters by which they are able to please the viewer’s eyes and give charisma to the action.
