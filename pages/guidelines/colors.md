usage-introduction: |
 Color is an element of visual language that people "recognize" before they are consciously aware of it. It "pops out" at viewers in the early stages of their vision process. Since color is a potent element of visual communication, we need to think through how and why we are using it.
 
 Reason to use colors
 * Establish identity
 * Speed up visual search
 * Improve object recognition
 * Enhance meaning
 * Convey structure
 * Show associations
 * Improve usability

 ### The color palette
 This color set is the expanded color palette for the Design System and reflects the style of Unit4, while being functional at the same time. It also contains support for accessibility. Keeping the appearance of colors consistent across Unit4 products, that is the goal of color management. 

 Each color swatch in the palette is labeled with the letters AA or AAA. AA means good text contrast, AAA means better/excellent text contrast. This contrast is measured between the text color and the swatch color, in case the swatch color is used as a background color with text placed on it. This does not mean we advise to use all swatch colors as background colors; in most cases text should simply be placed on a white or light-grey background.

 ### Text contrast rating AA/AAA
 The text color (on the swatches) is either Black or White, this depends on which text color works best on the background color (being the swatch color), for a normal text size and regular style.
 Other text colors should be tested for contrast using Colour Contrast Analyser, to make sure it passes the WCAG 2.0 accessibility requirements.

 ### Basic tips
 Avoid the temptation to use color as decoration. Colors should be used meaningfully and intentionally, in order to create patterns and visual cues.
 * A monochromatic palette is a great place to start. It ensures contrast in values and doesn’t distract the user with a clashing color combination. If more colors are needed add a neutral or almost neutral scale.
 * When using multiple colors, select one as a main color, then choose a few supporting colors-complementaries, analogous or neutrals.
 * Complementary combinations such as blue & orange or yellow & purple work well together aesthetically. Analogous colors - colors next to each other on the color wheel - such as blue and green also look nice.
 * Test your colors for accessibility with a colorblind simulator.
 * Test your text and background color for accessibility with an online contrast checker.
 * Avoid using your project’s primary color or Unit4 base colors in charts or graphics, e.g., the blue bars in your bar chart should not be the same blue color as the primary buttons.
