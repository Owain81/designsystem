# Vision
intro: Unit4 software helps their users by enabling them to do the 'things that make them happy' so they can have a joyful and productive day at work.

  - name: useful

      - "The first one is the base, the foundation, and the start of every relationship. First our software needs to be useful. If the user does not see why a task needs to be performed, the software can never be a great colleague."
      - "On one side, Unit4 software needs to boost productivity (make it simple and have a clear focus) and happiness (reward the user, use gamification, give good feedback). On the other side, it needs to fulfil the potential (take the user serious as a person, a colleague, and as a human being) of the user, and help the user to gain more knowledge (show additional information and do predictions), which can help them to perform even better than expected."
    chips: [Productivity, Fulfil potential, Gain knowledge, Happiness]

      - "The second layer is about acceptance. Just as in real life, our users need to accept our software. And we can achieve that by making sure the software is easy to learn and remember. Besides that, we should also make our software usable. As intuitive as possible. Our software needs to be so easy to use, that the user does not need any preparation or training."
      - "It also needs to be natural. Natural communication means it copies the natural world. Not only in words, but even more in behaviour. Lastly, the software needs to be effective. Keep it simple, get rid of all the noise, make it super easy and design software that will reduce the chances of making errors to as low as possible."

      - The third layer is the layer of identification. If a user can identify with the software, they will think the software is more reliable, intelligent, and knowledgeable. The user will even think they did a better job, and overall, enjoy the whole software experience more.
      - To enable the user to identify with the software, we need to prepare the software for any possible changes. The software should adapt to the context. An experience on a smartphone is different to on a desktop. The software needs to be knowledgeable. It needs to give the right answers at the right time. To finish this section, the software should always be learning. It needs to learn the user. What are the preferences, what is the history of the user? And how can the software adapt to that knowledge?

  - name: friendly

      - "And finally, on top of the pyramid, there is something we call ‘friendly‘. Our users want to be treated like they treat their own colleagues. This last part is about dedication (the drive), about being trustworthy (making no mistakes), about empathy (being gentle in your approach), and optimistic (encourage and motivate the user while performing a task)."
    chips:
      - Dedicated
      - Trustworthy
      - Empathic
      - Optimistic

Our Unit4 software needs to behave in the same way as a colleague. The best possible colleague. But, when do we consider a colleague great? To understand that we use a model:
